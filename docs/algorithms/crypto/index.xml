      <description>Randomness is used throughout the protocol in order to generate values and extend the blockchain. Random values are drawn from the Ticket Chain and appropriately formatted for usage. We describe this formatting below.
Encoding On-chain data for randomness Entropy from the ticket-chain can be combined with other values to generate necessary randomness that can be specific to (eg) a given miner address or epoch. To be used as part of entropy, these values are combined in objects that can then be CBOR-serialized according to their algebraic datatypes.</description>

      <description>Signatures are cryptographic functions that attest to the origin of a particular message. In the context of Filecoin, signatures are used to send and receive messages with the assurance that each message was generated by a specific entity. In other words, it is infeasible for an entity i to generate a signed message that appears to have been generated by j, with j != i.
Filecoin uses signatures to associate an action to a given party.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Random Function</title>

      <description>Filecoin uses the notion of a Verifiable Random Function (VRF). A VRF uses a private key to produce a digest of an arbitrary message such that the output is unique per signer and per message. Any third party in possession of the corresponding public key, the message, and the VRF output, can verify if the digest has been computed correctly and by the correct signer. Using a VRF in the ticket generation process allows anyone to verify if a block comes from an eligible block producer (see Ticket Generation for more details).</description>
